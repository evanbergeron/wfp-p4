\section*{User Testing Overview}

We targeted individuals that were either new to or experienced with Git.  The reason for this is that we envision our manual primary usage to be an introduction to the basics of Git for beginners as well as a quick reference for Git commands for intermediate to advanced users.

The reason we chose the coaching method for beginners is to better simulate a first-time experience with using Git.  Beginners will be handed a computer with a directory with several files and a list of tasks to accomplish.  The manual will be available as their primary source of help.

The think-aloud protocol is better for getting feedback from more experienced users since they can read the instructions and simultaneously compare it to their previous experience using and learning Git.

We plan on testing the whole draft on our users, since it is attended to be modularized for easier skimming with users being able to pick out sections that they need at the time.

\section*{Individual User Feedback}

\subsection*{Tim Becker}

\subsection*{Cole Heathershaw}

Overall, Cole was off-put by the overall tone of the manual.  In particular, he found some sections were ``too-personal."  Part of the inconsistency across sections in terms of tone is due to the way we allocated sections to individual group members.  Furthermore, Cole disagreed with the inclusion of the ``Why use Git?" section, which he considered unnecessary considering that most people opening a manual know why they are using the manual.

A larger portion of his feedback stemmed from his differentiation between guides and manuals, with manuals addressing more expert users and guides being closer to an introduction.  In this regard, our manual was more of a guide since our target audience consists of beginner and intermediate users of Git.

For some other feedback points, Cole mentioned the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Get rid of the use of ``we"
    \item Add warnings to some sections such as ``Deleting branches"
    \item Fix dangling sections
    \item Be more direct instead of suggesting in some sections (i.e. removing ``perhaps," ``want,")
    \item In ``Merging branches," what is the word ``This" referring to?
    \item The Problem/Solution/Description separation works sometimes, but in some sections the problem statement is so short to the point that it is redundant with the section header.
\end{itemize}
