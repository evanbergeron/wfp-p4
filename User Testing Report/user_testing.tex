\section*{User Testing Overview}

We targeted individuals that were either new to or experienced with Git.  The reason for this is that we envision our manual primary usage to be an introduction to the basics of Git for beginners as well as a quick reference for Git commands for intermediate to advanced users.

The reason we chose the coaching method for beginners is to better simulate a first-time experience with using Git.  Beginners will be handed a computer with a directory with several files and a list of tasks to accomplish.  The manual will be available as their primary source of help.

The think-aloud protocol is better for getting feedback from more experienced users since they can read the instructions and simultaneously compare it to their previous experience using and learning Git.

User & Level & Method & Contributor\\

Tim Becker & intermediate & coaching & Evan\\

Xinni Wu & beginner & coaching & Ziyang\\
Di Wong & intermediate & think aloud & Ziyang\\
George Situ & beginner & coaching & Nishad\\

We plan on testing the whole draft on our users, since it is attended to be modularized for easier skimming with users being able to pick out sections that they need at the time.
