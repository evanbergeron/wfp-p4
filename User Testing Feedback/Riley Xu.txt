Feedback from Riley Xu (Intermediate):

- Explain the difference between rebasing and merging more clearly
- Emphasize that switching branches the changes made to current branch are
  reverted
- Specify when to delete branches and when to merge them
- Good use of graphics and Visuals
- Fix grammatical errors
- Include a cheatsheet at the end i.e. a list of common git commands and
  references to them in the manual
- More detail needed in git add (e.g. git add ., git add -A)
- Did not introduce Git commit hashes, therefore the section on reverting 
  changes and git history can be confusing to readers
- In the images in installation section, zoom in on the relevant section
- It was unclear how to actually make a Git alias
