Feedback from Cole Heathershaw (Intermediate):

- Put some warnings (i.e. for deleting branches, implications of deleting a branch)
- Get rid of 'we'
- Fix dangling sections
- "Why use Git" might not be needed (user already knows they want to use Git if they are opening the manual)
- Maybe shouldn't be named "Git Instruction Manual" (maybe a "Guide").  Manuals are supposed to be in 2nd person.
- The anecdotes seem to personal for a manual
- Section 2.2: 'If you have Mac'
- Dangling sentences without periods when followed by code
- 3.2, "git init" is shown too late
- Major: General tone is wrong for a manual: shouldn't be suggestive i.e. "Perhaps", "want", etc.  Be direct.
- There are a couple grammatical errors (i.e. installing Magit)
- Merging branches (solution): what is "This"?
- P/S/D works sometimes, but don't make it a sentence one-liner for problem otherwise it seems redundant with section header
