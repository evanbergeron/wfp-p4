Feedback from Di Wang (Intermediate):

- There are disconnected few words on start of page 6 and 7, need to respect.
- Explain <SHA> in “reverting changes” section.
- Try to make the names of example files consistent.
- Move the “Collaboration with Github” section to end.
- Tones in this document is a bit inconsistent
- The P/S/D structure works well and instructions are overall clear.
- Good use of visuals in Cherry-picking and Rebasing
