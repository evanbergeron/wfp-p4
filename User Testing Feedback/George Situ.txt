Feedback:
(User is quite unfamiliar with Terminal usage)

- Document is very long
- Was typing the commands without strong understand of what was actually being done
  - The Problem/Solution/Discussion should help because it tells you exactly what problem each command is addressing
- A section on how to use the document would be helpful
- More visuals besides just the graphs of project structure
- Leave out some of the in depth technical discussion
- More consistency in descriptions and voice/tone
