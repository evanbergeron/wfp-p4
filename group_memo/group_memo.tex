The purpose of this memo is to identify, articulate, and justify our
visual and verbal strategies while writing and revising our project 4.

\section*{Visual Strategies}

We employed a number of visual strategies to aid reading.

For the section on installing Git, we included screenshots of the different steps of the installation process so that users are not lost while going through the steps to install Git on the computer.

We chose to make inline code and block-style code chunks both blue, in
order to clearly distinguish between code and prose. We chose to use
the monospace font \texttt{Computer Modern Typewriter} for code
sections.

Furthermore, we found that in practice explaining Git's version history through words alone can often confuse listeners.  Thus, to better explain the changes to Git's version history when rebasing and cherry-picking, we incorporated the use of diagrams with individual nodes representing commits.  These provided a visual representation of changes to Git's version history when using these commands.

\section*{Verbal Strategies}

TODO audience adaptation (intro / intermediate accomodation)

TODO document organization (sections, subsections)

Another strategy we incorporated was the use of the Problem, Solution, and Discussion subsections.  Our original document faced issues where readers would have to read the entirety of a section in order to understand what was required to accomplish their required task.  This did not facilitate the random-access-reading that we envisioned for this manual.  Furthermore, our document often combined both reading-to-do and reading-to-learn in this manner.  As such, the choice to break down each section into these three subsections separated reading-to-do to the Problem and Solution sections while reading-to-learn was left to the Discussion section.  Thus, if a reader wished to quickly look up a command for a particular situation, they would simply find the respective section, check if the problem description matches their situation, and apply the solution.  If they wished to get a better understanding of the command, the Discussion section would go into more detail on the under-workings of the command.
